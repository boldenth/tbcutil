## tbcutil

This repository is meant to be a library of functions and data structures in C that 
I have found useful over the years. I intend to use this as a reference in the 
future, so I aim for the most optimal solutions. It is also the idea that every
piece of code conforms to the C Standard.

If you notice any inefficient (or just plain wrong) implementations, feel free 
to submit a pull request!

### vectors

TODO

### strings

Most of the string functions are implemented optimally, but there are some functions missing. Notably: `string_len()`, `string_substr()`

### hashes

TODO

### [extra](extra)

Here you will find random or quirky things that I find interesting and / or 
noteworthy.
